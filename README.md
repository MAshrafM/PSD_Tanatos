# Tanatos
A PSD to HTML/SCSS/JQuery project.  
Design is based on symu.co web design, the PSD file is available online and you can find it [here](https://www.mediafire.com/?p265b6do013yb0z)  

Converting the final design into a Front-End web page with a slight animation using HTML, SCSS & JQuery. 

Instead of extracting icon assets from PSD we used Font-awesome, And for scroll animation used niceScroll.  

Using gulp Task Runner for auto-refresh and compiling SCSS into CSS.  

This was a front end web series project by ElZero [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzVWN837CWYXS18LJ69HvRV), in html,css,jquery. 

## Future: 
- Adding Menu Nav. 
- Making site responsive.
- Adding Animation.  
- Turning it to full site with ROR/Node.
